## Classical problems

### - **Binary Trees**

#### _**Problem: Diameter of Binary Tree**_

> Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

### - **Graphs**

#### _**Problem: Network Delay Time**_

> There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
> Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
> Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

#### _**Problem: Height Checker**_

> Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

> Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

## Hard

#### _**Problem: Largest Range**_

> Write a function that takes in an array of integers and find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

> Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

#### [Solution](Hard/largestRange.py)

#### _**Problem: Min Rewards**_

> Write a function that takes in a list of scores and returns the minimum number of rewards that you must give out to students to satisfy the two rules:

> 1.  All students must receive at least one reward.
> 2.  Any give student must receive strictly more rewards than an adjacent student with a lower score and must receive striclty fewer rewards than an adjacent student with a higher score.

#### [Solution](Hard/minRewards.py)
